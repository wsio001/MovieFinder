## Instruction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application needs API key to run. Find out more here. You will need an account to get an api key

After getting an API key, download the app and then create a file name key.js in `/src` and put `export let key = "YOUR API KEY"`.


Simply run `npm install` then `npm start` in this directory will start the application.
