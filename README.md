## Instruction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application needs API key to run. Find out more here
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

After getting an API key, download the app and then either change the value of the `API_KEY` variable in App.js to personal Api key or create a file name key.js in `/src` and put `export let key = "YOUR API KEY"`.

Simply run `npm start` in this directory will start the application.
